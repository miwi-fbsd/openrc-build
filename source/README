# Local Development Source Directory
#
# When building ports, sometimes you want to do rapid
# development iteration without needing to bump ports each time
#
# You can checkout local sources into this directory, which
# will in turn be copied into /usr/ports/local_source during
# the "make ports" phase of building
#
# Example
# git clone https://github.com/freenas/freenas
